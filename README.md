# Python Thesis helper

This python application helps by creating a scientific thesis with LaTeX. It creates a folder structure used to store the different TeX files for the chapters and other data files as well as backups and a lot more. It comes with some TeX files that are put together by the program to create some initial files. It also has the ability to create overview files and file archives for backups.

At the core of the tool is a compiler file used to compile TeX files externally without opening anything like TeXMaker or TeXStudio. This was taken from the web and the rest of the tool was build around it.

In order to use this tool, run the script ThesisHelper.py with a standard Python 3 interpreter. There will be explanations of what is going on.
